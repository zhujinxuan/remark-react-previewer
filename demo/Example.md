# Hello, this is the markdown Previewer with 

This is the demo of
[remark-react-previewer](https://github.com/zhujinxuan/remark-react-previewer),
an auto-scroll markdown previewer.  You can move around your cursor, or edit the
markdown text to see how it works.

## What is markdown

see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language

You can move cursor around paragraph and Blockquote to scroll the menu.

## List

Normally, the scrolled node only matches `listItem` in the list.  But you can match

Of course, you can match nested lists.  

1. Write markdown 
2. [x] Checked
3. [ ] unChecked
  - Of course, you could move around the nested list
  - another nested list

## Table

You can move around in the table. The scrolled node could be tableRow or tableCell.  You can match table by 
pass some strange position like `{line:line, column:999999}`.

| foo | bar |
| :-- | :-: |
| baz | qux |

Of course we can render *emphasis* and **strong**, but we will not directly scroll to nodes of these two sorts.  
Personally, I do not think it would be a great idea to scroll to inline link or inline image. 


## Code
If you want code highlight, import `highlight.js` yourself.  The css class of pre is consistent with `highlight.js`. 
But I do not import it as default.

``` scheme
(
 (lambda (f n cache) (if 
                (= n 0)
                cache
                 (f f (- n 1) (* cache n))
                ))
 (lambda (f n cache) (if 
                (= n 0)
                cache
                 (f f (- n 1) (* cache n))
                ))
 10 
 1
 )
```

BTW, most styling in this page is done by `skeleton.css`, and it is not imported as default in the previewer. 
The default styling is just `overflow:scroll` and background-color for the scrolled node.

The development of footnote support will begin when I find a good design for showing footnotes.
